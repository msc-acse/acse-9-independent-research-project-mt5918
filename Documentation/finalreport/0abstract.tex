\begin{abstract}
A recent state-of the arts review by \texttt{EU} decision makers revealed that current building guidelines are not taking into account threats such as natural disasters and acts of terrorism, see \cite{Sto15}. Updating these guidelines requires accurate numerical models to quantify the resilience of building elements against explosive and projectile impact.

The Applied Modelling and Computation Group (\texttt{AMCG}) at Imperial College London has recently developed a novel coupled dynamic gas/solid \texttt{FEMDEM} code.

In this paper, this \texttt{Y} code is applied to simulate \texttt{2D} projectile impact on laminated glass. Furthermore, a novel implementation is presented to prepare and write \texttt{VTK} output files. Before, obsolete external \texttt{VTK} libraries were required to visualise the code output.

The simulation results are not realistic, indicating errors in the preparation software or in the underlying code. The implementation of \texttt{VTK} files is successful and valid output files are produced. The files are visualisable using \texttt{Paraview}.
